The University of Windsor’s exciting history and continued transformation

The story of our university began in September of 1857, when the first students arrived to study at its predecessor, Assumption College.

In the 160+ years since, the small Roman Catholic college gave rise to a non-denominational, comprehensive, teaching and learning university. More than 16,000 students attend the University of Windsor today and its alumni family boasts 100,000 members.

Here are some highlights that have marked our century and a half of academic achievement and excellence.
